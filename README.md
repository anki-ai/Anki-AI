# Anki AI

  

A robust and flexible system for managing AI agent memories, experiences, and knowledge acquisition. This project provides a comprehensive framework for storing, processing, and utilizing agent experiences to improve decision-making and learning capabilities.

  

## Overview

  

Anki is designed to mirror human-like memory structures, implementing three key memory types:

  

### 1. Episodic Memory

- Stores sequential experiences and events

- Maintains temporal relationships

- Enables learning from past experiences

- Supports pattern recognition across similar events

  

### 2. Semantic Memory

- Manages factual knowledge and concepts

- Builds relationships between concepts

- Supports knowledge inference

- Enables concept similarity and relationship mapping

  

### 3. Working Memory

- Handles active, temporary information

- Priority-based memory management

- Automatic cleanup of outdated information

- Efficient access to currently relevant data

  

## Key Features

  

### Advanced Memory Processing

- Pattern detection in experiences

- Anomaly detection

- Causal relationship analysis

- Knowledge compilation and inference

  

### Efficient Storage

- File-based persistence

- LRU caching with TTL support

- Automatic backup and recovery

- Index-based quick retrieval

  

### Flexible Agent Implementation

- Base agent framework

- Reactive and learning agent implementations

- Customizable decision-making processes

- Experience-based learning capabilities
